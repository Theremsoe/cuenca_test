# Backtracking Algorithm for N-Queens Problem

"""
Backtracking is a systematic algorithmic technique for finding solutions to problems that involve finding
an arrangement of elements satisfying certain constraints. It explores the search space by incrementally
building candidates and backtracking when a dead-end or invalid solution is encountered.

Here, we are using backtracking as a baseline algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem before applying
other techniques like hill climbing and genetic algorithms. The goal is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard
in such a way that no two queens are attacking each other. The constraints are that no two queens should be
in the same row, column, or diagonal.

The backtracking algorithm for the N-Queens problem follows these steps:
1. Start with an empty board.
2. Try placing a queen in the first column of the first row.
3. If a queen can be placed without conflicts, move to the next column and repeat step 2.
4. If all queens are placed successfully, a valid solution is found.
5. If a conflict is encountered, backtrack to the previous column and try a different position for the
   queen in that column.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all valid solutions are found or all possibilities have been explored.

The algorithm ensures that only valid and non-attacking queen placements are considered, leading to a
solution where no two queens attack each other.

By starting with backtracking as a baseline, we can compare and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency
of other techniques like hill climbing and genetic algorithms for solving the N-Queens problem.

Let's proceed with the implementation.
